the torah speaks of four children : one is wise , one is wicked , one is simple and one does not know how to ask .
the wise one , what does he say ? what are the testimonies , the statutes and the laws which the l-rd , our g-d , has commanded you ? you , in turn , shall instruct him in the laws of passover , [ up to ] one is not to eat any dessert after the passover-lamb .
the wicked one , what does he say ? what is this service to you ?! he says to you , but not to him ! by thus excluding himself from the community he has denied that which is fundamental . you , therefore , blunt his teeth and say to him : it is because of this that the l-rd did for me when i left egypt ; for me - but not for him ! if he had been there , he would not have been redeemed !
the simpleton , what does he say ? what is this ? thus you shall say to him : with a strong hand the l-rd took us out of egypt , from the house of slaves .
as for the one who does not know how to ask , you must initiate him , as it is said : you shall tell your child on that day , it is because of this that the l-rd did for me when i left egypt .
