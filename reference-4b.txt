the torah speaks of four types of children : one is wise , one is wicked , one is simple , and one does not know how to ask .
the wise one asks : what is the meaning of the laws and traditions g-d has commanded ? you should teach him all the traditions of passover , even to the last detail .
the wicked one asks : what does this ritual mean to you ? by using the expression to you he excludes himself from his people and denies g-d . shake his arrogance and say to him : it is because of what the l-rd did for me when i came out of egypt ... for me and not for him -- for had he been in egypt , he would not have been freed .
the simple one asks : what is all this ? you should tell him : it was with a mighty hand that the l-rd took us out of egypt , out of the house of bondage .
as for the one who does not know how to ask , you should open the discussion for him , as it is written : and you shall explain to your child on that day , it is because of what the l-rd did for me when i came out of egypt .
